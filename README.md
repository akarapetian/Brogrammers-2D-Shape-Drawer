# Brogrammers-2D-Shape-Drawer

This is going to become our new repository.

Im trying to make the project as simple as possible, and meet all the requirements. 



BUGS:
- 7th shape isn't being read by the parser at all (FIXED)
- The third item in the vector, (the polygon) is not rendering its id alongside its shape

Currently we need to:

- add shapes
- delete shapes
- report shape perimeters and areas (FINISHED)
- move shapes (FINISHED)
- save shapes file and re-write it for next time the project runs

- add a "contact us section", with team name and logo (FINISHED)

- create uml diagrams of the project
- run valgrind
- run doxygen

- make everything look pretty

and thats literally it
