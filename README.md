# Brogrammers-2D-Shape-Drawer

This is going to become our new repository.

Im trying to make the project as simple as possible, and meet all the requirements. 



BUGS:
7th shape isn't being read by the parser at all (FIXED)

Currently we need to:

- add shapes
- delete shapes
- report shape perimeters and areas (FINISHED) (for the most part)
- move shapes (finished for line, circle, ellipse, working on the rest of the shapes now)

- add a "contact us section", with team name and logo (FINISHED)

- create uml diagrams of the project
- run valgrind
- run doxygen

- make everything look pretty

and thats literally it
